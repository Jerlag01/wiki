# Discord
Since the launch of the Mythica's Vanilla server and also for the modded there is a discord bridge between the Minecraft servers and Discord itself. 

By doing so a Discord bot has been created in the Discord Developers platform.

The current purpose of the Discord bot is to only serve as that bridge, but in the background we're working on releasing an addition to it. To handle more then just the connection between Minecraft and Discord.

A list of commands will soon be provided once approved by the Praesidium.
