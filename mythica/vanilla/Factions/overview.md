# Overview
> Somehow, the plugin authors have done so little documentation that the best option we have is to use the UniversalCraft documentation as a diving board and move from there. Due to this, this plugin page MAY be missing portions of commands, although we believe they should be properly accounted for.
{.is-warning}

SaberFactions is an advanced (yet badly documented) factions plugin for use with Minecraft Java servers based on MassiveCrafts Factions plugin, similar to Mythica Vanilla. SaberFactions is used to create new factions, wage wars, and manage claimed land in an easy-to-use manner.

# Commands Layout

{.is-info}

The documentation for SaberFactions will be divided into divisions based on their overall usage, and frequency. If you are viewing on PC, you may see a quick reference area to the left-hand side of the screen that you may be able to use to assist navigation.

Note that all `/faction` commands can be shortened to just `/f`
