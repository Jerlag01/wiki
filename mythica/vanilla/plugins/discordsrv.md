# Header
[DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) is a plugin the Server uses to link up the in-game-chat with discord, to allow for more seamless communication, as well as to show people who's online and when. 

# Vanilla Mythica Intergration
DiscordSRV is used in Vanilla to link all gamemodes to the discord in terms of chat. We use the plugin to deeply integrate features into the Mythica's Experiences

We currently do not force synchronisation between the minecraft server and Discord and the other way, but might be planned in the future.
