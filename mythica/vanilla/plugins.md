# Plugins Overview
A plugin (or a multiplayer plug-in) is **an additive file for a Minecraft multiplayer server**. Plugins are often used to change certain aspects of the game, such as adding user rankings, or the addition of a "factions" game mode. Plugins do not change the game itself, as a mod does.

Mythica Vanilla Features over 19 plugins, each of which is designed for a different task and purpose.
> **With the release of Vanilla Mythica, some plugins might not yet be in here, but we will get to them later on.**

## List of Plugin Dependencies
Some plugins require dependencies in order to function correctly. Dependencies are the plugins that other plugins use to function. Think of them like the reference material for an essay you write, you didn't start from zero, but you built up on previous material. Dependencies act just like that.
